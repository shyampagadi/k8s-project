### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes cluster (local or cloud-based)
- kubectl installed and configured
- Docker installed
- Knowledge of Helm (optional)

### Step 1: Setting Up the Project Directory
Create a project directory with the following structure:
```
voting-app/
├── frontend/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── src/
├── backend/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── src/
├── database/
│   └── init.sql
├── k8s/
│   ├── frontend-deployment.yaml
│   ├── backend-deployment.yaml
│   ├── postgres-deployment.yaml
│   ├── ingress.yaml
│   ├── configmap.yaml
│   └── secret.yaml
└── README.md
```

### Step 2: Frontend Application
#### 2.1 Create Frontend Application

Use a simple React app for the frontend.

**Dockerfile for Frontend**:
```dockerfile
# Frontend Dockerfile
FROM node:14 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY ./src /app/src
COPY package.json /app/
RUN npm install
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

#### 2.2 Frontend Source Code

You can use this simple React example for your `src` folder. Create an `index.js` file:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Voting Application</h1>
      <p>Vote for your favorite option!</p>
      {/* Voting Logic Goes Here */}
    </div>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

### Step 3: Backend Application
#### 3.1 Create Backend Application

Use a simple Node.js Express API for the backend.

**Dockerfile for Backend**:
```dockerfile
# Backend Dockerfile
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

#### 3.2 Backend Source Code

In your backend folder, create a simple Express server. Here's a basic `server.js` file:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const cors = require('cors');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.use(cors());
app.use(bodyParser.json());

let votes = {};

app.post('/vote', (req, res) => {
  const { option } = req.body;
  votes[option] = (votes[option] || 0) + 1;
  res.json({ success: true, votes });
});

app.get('/results', (req, res) => {
  res.json(votes);
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

### Step 4: Database Initialization
#### 4.1 Create Database Initialization Script

In the `database` folder, create an `init.sql` file to set up your PostgreSQL database:
```sql
CREATE TABLE votes (
    option VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    count INT DEFAULT 0
);
```

### Step 5: Kubernetes Deployment Files
#### 5.1 ConfigMap and Secret
Create `k8s/configmap.yaml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
data:
  BACKEND_URL: "http://backend-service:3000"
```

Create `k8s/secret.yaml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: db-secret

kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: postgres-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

### Step 7: Ingress Configuration
Create `k8s/ingress.yaml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: voting-app-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
    - host: app1.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: frontend
                port:
                  number: 80
    - host: app2.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: backend
                port:
                  number: 3000
```

### Step 8: Deploying the Application
1. **Apply the Persistent Volume and Claim**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/postgres-pv-pvc.yaml
   ```

2. **Create the ConfigMap and Secret**:
   ```bash


   kubectl apply -f k8s/configmap.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/secret.yaml
   ```

3. **Deploy the Frontend and Backend**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/backend-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/postgres-deployment.yaml
   ```

4. **Apply the Ingress Configuration**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress.yaml
   ```

### Step 9: Accessing the Application
1. Update your `/etc/hosts` file (or DNS) to point the domain names (e.g., `app1.example.com`, `app2.example.com`) to the IP of your Ingress controller.
2. Open your web browser and access the application using the configured domain names.

### Step 10: Monitoring and Logging (Optional)
Integrate a monitoring tool like Prometheus and Grafana to visualize metrics and logs from your application. You can set up sidecar containers or use a logging operator to collect logs.

Feel free to ask if you need any specific resources, links, or additional details on any of the steps!


## Improvements after Phase 1:

It looks like you've shared a comprehensive configuration for your voting application deployed on Kubernetes. Here’s a quick overview of what your configuration files include:

1. **Namespace**: You've created a namespace named `voting` to isolate your application's resources.

2. **Ingress**: The Ingress resource routes traffic to two different services based on the hostnames `voting.com` and `result.com`. It uses an NGINX ingress controller, and the rewrite target is set to `/`.

3. **Database Deployment**: You've set up a PostgreSQL deployment (`db`) with environment variables for the user and password. The deployment has resource limits and exposes port 5432.

4. **Database Service**: A service named `db` that exposes port 5432 for the database.

5. **Redis Deployment**: You have a Redis deployment (`redis`) for caching purposes, also with specified resource limits and exposing port 6379.

6. **Redis Service**: A service for Redis to expose its port.

7. **Result Deployment**: A deployment for the result service, which utilizes the `dockersamples/examplevotingapp_result` image and exposes port 80.

8. **Result Service**: A service that exposes the result deployment on port 8081.

9. **Vote Deployment**: This deployment runs the voting service with the `dockersamples/examplevotingapp_vote` image and exposes port 80.

10. **Vote Service**: A service for the voting deployment that maps to port 8080.

11. **Worker Deployment**: A deployment for a worker component using the `dockersamples/examplevotingapp_worker` image, with specified resource limits.

### Suggestions and Improvements
1. **Resource Management**: Make sure the resource limits match your actual usage and consider adding requests for CPU and memory to better manage resources.

2. **Service Type**: You might want to uncomment the `type: LoadBalancer` lines for your services if you want external access (depending on your cloud provider and setup).

3. **Secrets Management**: Consider using Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive information like database passwords instead of plain environment variables.

4. **Health Checks**: Implement readiness and liveness probes for your deployments to ensure they are running correctly and can be restarted if they fail.

5. **Networking Policies**: Depending on your security requirements, you may want to define Network Policies to restrict traffic between pods.

Making your Helm-based Kubernetes project production-ready involves several important steps to enhance security, scalability, and maintainability. Here’s a detailed guide to help you prepare your project for production:

### 1. **Resource Management**

- **Define Resource Requests and Limits**: Specify resource requests and limits in your Helm charts for CPU and memory. This ensures that your application gets the required resources and prevents it from overusing them, which can lead to performance degradation or crashes.

  ```yaml
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: "250m"
      memory: "512Mi"
    limits:
      cpu: "500m"
      memory: "1Gi"
  ```

### 2. **Environment Configuration**

- **Externalize Configuration**: Use ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage application configuration and sensitive information (like API keys, passwords, etc.). Avoid hardcoding values in your application.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: app-config
  data:
    APP_ENV: "production"
  ```

### 3. **Security Hardening**

- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Implement RBAC to restrict permissions for your Kubernetes resources. Only grant the minimum required permissions for your application components.

- **Network Policies**: Define network policies to control the traffic flow between your application components and external access.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: NetworkPolicy
  metadata:
    name: allow-app
  spec:
    podSelector:
      matchLabels:
        app: your-app
    policyTypes:
      - Ingress
      - Egress
    ingress:
      - from:
          - podSelector:
              matchLabels:
                role: frontend
  ```

### 4. **High Availability and Scalability**

- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**: Set up an HPA to automatically scale your pods based on CPU/memory usage or custom metrics.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: autoscaling/v1
  kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
  metadata:
    name: my-app-hpa
  spec:
    scaleTargetRef:
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: Deployment
      name: my-app
    minReplicas: 2
    maxReplicas: 10
    targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 80
  ```

### 5. **Monitoring and Logging**

- **Implement Monitoring**: Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring your application metrics. Set up alerts for critical metrics (like high error rates or resource usage).

- **Centralized Logging**: Integrate logging solutions such as ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Fluentd to collect and visualize logs from all your pods.

### 6. **Backup and Recovery**

- **Database Backups**: Implement automated backups for your database using tools like Velero or custom scripts to ensure data can be restored in case of failure.

### 7. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**

- **Set Up CI/CD Pipelines**: Use CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions to automate your deployment process. This ensures consistent builds, testing, and deployment.

### 8. **Testing and Validation**

- **End-to-End Testing**: Implement automated tests to validate application functionality and performance before deploying to production.

### 9. **Service Mesh Integration (Optional)**

- **Service Mesh**: Consider using a service mesh like Istio or Linkerd for advanced traffic management, security, and observability features.

### 10. **Documentation**

- **Update Documentation**: Ensure all configuration and deployment processes are well-documented to assist team members and facilitate onboarding.

### Conclusion

Taking these steps will greatly enhance the robustness and reliability of your application, making it ready for production. Always remember to test each component thoroughly in a staging environment that closely mirrors your production setup before rolling out changes.
